This is my first REACT application TODOLIST
The application is about tasks in our daily lives.
To run this application,follow the steps:
  run the command in terminal "cd vite-project"(as the project name is vite-project")
  run the command "npm run dev" to run the application,then click on the link to use.
In the project i used 4 components namely header,todolist,todoitem and app.jsx.
With the help of states and props , i managed to call other components without complex code and with different context.
