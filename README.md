This is my firts project in REACT # todo-application-REACT
The application is about the TODO LIST in our daily lives,wher we can mark,edit and delete the tasks.
The application is developed using components named app.jsx,,todoitem.jsx,todolist.jsx,header.jsx
In main.jsx file we called app.jsx and from app.jsx we called header.jsx and todolist.jsx
The component todolist.jsx calls the todoitem.jsx.
